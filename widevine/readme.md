## L1

- Amazon needs AndroidCDM L1 for 720P/1080P/4K
- Disney+ needs Android L1 for 1080P+

## What is a CDM?

The way it works, is you need a key to decrypt the media. To get that key, you
make a request to a license server, and they give you the key back. However the
key returned from the license server, is **itself encrypted**, so before you can
use the key, you have to decrypt it. Thats what the CDM is for. Without the
CDM, you cant decrypt the key, and you cant then use the decrypted key to
decrypt some media. theres **a lot** more detail to it, but thats the high
level view of whats going on.
